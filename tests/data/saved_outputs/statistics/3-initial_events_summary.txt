Statistics for: overall
Total simulations = 1
No snapshots per simulation = 1000

Parameters used for pre-selection of input tunnels for clustering:
length >= 5.00 A
radius >= 0.75 A
curvature <= 5.00

Active tunnel filters:
length = (5.00, 999.00) A
radius = (1.00, 999.00) A
curvature = (1.00, 999.00)
occurred in at least 0 simulations
occurred in at least 1 snapshots
occurred in at least 0.000 snapshots on average per simulation
has at least 0 transport events
has at least 0 entry events
has at least 0 release events
